1. Find all solutions to the equation \( 5z^5 + 15z^4 + 20z^3 + 15z^2 + 5z + 1= 0 \).

2. Consider the function \( f : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N} \) defined by:

let \( p_n \) be the nth prime number, and let \( S = \{n_1, n_2, n_3, ...\} \) then \( f \) is given by:

\( f(S) = p_1^{n_1} * p_2^{n_2} * ... \) 

Show that this is in fact not a counterexample to Cantor's theorem.

3. Show that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the statement that a polynomial of degree \( n \) has exactly  \( n \) complex roots (including multiplicity), are equivalent.

4. Show that if \( G \) and \( H \) are groups of cardinality \( p \) where \( p \) is prime, then \( G \) and \( H \) are isomorphic.

5. Show that there are no solutions to the diophantine equation \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \) if both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd.


** Computational

1. Find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( n\ln{n} > 3^{197} \)
